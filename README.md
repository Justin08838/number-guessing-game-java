# Number Guessing Game (Java)

## Description
A **console-based number guessing game** written in Java.  
The program generates a random number between **1 and 100**, and the user has to guess it.  
It provides hints like "Too high" or "Too low" until the correct number is guessed.

This project demonstrates **loops, conditional logic, random number generation, and input handling** — perfect for beginners learning Java.

## Features
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100  
- Provides hints: Too high / Too low  
- Counts the number of attempts  
- Accepts input from the user via console  
- Displays a congratulatory message when the number is guessed correctly

## Technologies Used
- Java  
- Scanner class for user input  
- Random class for random number generation

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Java installed** on your system.  
2. Clone or download this repository.  
3. Open terminal/command prompt in the project directory.  
4. Compile the program:  
   ```bash
   javac Main.

5.Run the program

     java Main

6.Follow the on-screen prompts to guess the number.

Guess a number between 1 and 100: 50
Too low, try again.
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 75
Too high, try again.
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 63
Correct! Congratulations 🎉🎉
You guessed it in 3 attempts.


What I Learned
Using Random class for generating numbers
Implementing loops for repeated input
Handling conditional logic with if-else statements
Tracking user attempts
Building an interactive console application



Future Improvements
Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
Allow the user to set the range of numbers
Add high-score tracking
Convert the game to a GUI-based version in Java

If you want, I can also **give the exact folder structure with the final `Main.java` code** ready to push to GitHub so this repo is completely professional and portfolio-ready.  

Do you want me to do that?
